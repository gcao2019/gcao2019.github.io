   			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>The X-ray Systems Lab aims at developing novel biomedical imaging technologies for biomedical and bioscientific discovery, radiological diagnosis, and medical intervention.  Directed by Dr. Guohua Cao, the lab focuses at novel X-ray sources, detectors, signal processing, image reconstruction algorithms, as well as systems engineering. 
Our research activities are interdisciplinary and translational, and interface between basic sciences, translational development, and clinical applications. [<a href="research.html">Read more...</a>]</p>
