   	<h2>Research Background</h2>
   	<p>
    Ever since its discovery over a century ago, x-ray has revolutionized every aspect of our lives.  A computed tomography (CT) scanner is an x-ray based imaging system that is capable of providing non-invasive three-dimensional (3D) images, and has a wide range of applications in clinical healthcare, industrial inspection, airline security, forensic investigation, scientific research, and many others. </p>
<p>   Our research is directed at biomedical x-ray imaging.  The focus is to develop novel x-ray imaging technologies through novel x-ray sources, detectors, and systems engineering. We aim for developing next-generation x-ray imaging technologies that are faster, safer, compact, portable, and flexible. </p>

   	<h3> Carbon Nanotube X-ray Imaging </h3>
   <p>
   <b>Carbon nanotube dynamic micro-CT</b>: The goal is to develop a dynamic micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanner with enhanced spatial and temporal resolutions, using the novel field emission micro-focus x-ray sources based on carbon nanotubes (CNT) field emitters. Here we utilize one of the unique advantages of a field-emission x-ray source: the ultrafast electronic switching and easy programming capability. Imaging sequence in a CNT dynamic micro-CT scanner can be readily synchronized to <em>non-periodic</em> physiological signals of free-breathing mice, hence dramatically reducing the physiological motion and producing much clearer delineation in morphology.  Physiological functional information can also be obtained from imaging gated at the desired physiological phases.  </p>
   <p>
   Previously, we have successfully developed a prototype CNT dynamic micro-CT scanner and applied it to high-resolution imaging of various <em>in vivo</em> mouse models, including respiratory gated lung imaging, cardiac-and-respiratory gated cardiac imaging, atherosclerotic imaging, liver tumor imaging, as well as lung and colon cancer imaging. Recently, we further refined this CNT micro-CT to allow interior micro-CT imaging at greatly (up to 85%) reduced radiation dose. CNT interior micro-CT has been applied to image mouse hearts. [<a href="gallery.html">See some images at the gallery...</a>]
</p>
   <p>
   We have brought this CNT dynamic micro-CT to a fully functional imaging device and shared the nove technology with the broad research community.  Dr. Cao has built two CNT micro-CT scanners as the core imaging facilities in two institutions: one in the Biomedical Research Imaging Center at UNC-Chapel Hill; and the other in the Department of Radiology at University of Iowa - Carver College of Medicine.

   <h3>Carbon Nanotubes Field Emission X-Ray Sources and Source Arrays</h3>
   <p>
   Carbon nanotube x-ray source technology is viewed by many to be a disruptive technology that has the potential to fundamentally change how x-ray is generated and utilized.  Dr. Cao has extensive experiences in developing this novel x-ray source technology. He has invented and engineered a series of technologies/processes for reliably generating x-ray radiations from carbon nanotube field emitters. As a result, power/flux and lifetime of carbon nanotube x-ray sources were increased by more than 10-fold from previously reported values; both are critically important for in vivo biomedical imaging of small animals and ultrafast medical imaging of human subjects.</p>

   <h3> Multi-Source Interior Computed Tomography </h3>
<p>
    In current CT architecture, both x-ray tubes and x-ray detectors are rotated mechanically around an object to collect large amounts of projection data. This architecture is not fast enough for patients with high or irregular heart rates.  Furthermore, both x-ray beams and detectors of the current architecture are made wide enough so that the entire object is covered in the lateral direction without data truncation.  Consequently, the high radiation dose from CT imaging remains a heightened public concern (especially for cardiac CT). To overcome these problems, we came out with an innovative stationary-sources CT architecture based on three stationary distributed x-ray sources and three smaller rotating x-ray detectors.  Each distributed x-ray source has about 100 distinctive x-ray focal spots, and each detector has a narrower width compared to the conventional CT detectors. The new CT architecture will have a field-of-view of 200mm in diameter at isocenter, which is large enough to image many internal organs including hearts.  X-rays from the distributed sources are activated electronically to simulate the mechanical spinning of conventional single-beam x-ray sources with a high speed. The activation of individual x-ray beam will be synchronized to the corresponding rotating detector at the opposite end. Three source-detector chains can work in parallel to acquire three projections simultaneously and improve temporal resolution.  Lower full-body radiation dose is expected for the proposed CT architecture because x-rays are restricted to irradiate a local smaller region.  Taken together, the proposed CT architecture will enable <=50ms temporal resolution and reduce radiation dose significantly.

   <h3> X-ray Phase Contrast Imaging </h3>
   <p>
   X-ray phase contrast imaging refers to using the phases shift introduced in an x-ray beam as it traverses a body to give contrast.  Conventional x-ray imaging does not show the effects of the deflection of the trajectories of the x-rays in the images because of the large size of the x-ray source.  Major advantage of phase contrast imaging over conventional imaging is enhanced image quality at reduced radiation dose.
   </p>
   <p>
   We have built an x-ray phase contrast imaging system using a micro-focus x-ray source and a high-resolution CCD camera arranged in high magnification geometry such that small features down to 10 microns can be resolved.  With this system, we have investigated x-ray phase contrast imaging of technical samples, simulated breast phantoms, and actual malignant biological tissues. We are actively investigating some new phase retreival methods such as structured illumination based method and physics-model based computation method. Our goal is to develop and engineer a compact x-ray phase contrast imaging system suitable for clinical applications.
