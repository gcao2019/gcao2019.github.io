   <h2>About Us</h2>
<p>The X-ray Systems Lab aims at developing novel medical imaging technologies for biomedical and bioscientific discovery, radiological diagnosis, and medical intervention.  Directed by Dr. Guohua Cao, the lab focuses on unique x-ray sources, detectors, and systems engineering.  Our research activities are interdisciplinary and translational, and interface between basic sciences, translational development, and clinical applications.
